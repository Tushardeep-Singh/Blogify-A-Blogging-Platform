# Blogify-A-Blogging-Platform

Welcome to Blogify, a blogging platform where users can post new blogs, edit them, and view a collection of all blogs. This project was built with the intent of learning and showcasing my skills in web development.

## Features

* An introductory page with a welcoming message. Note: Please open the website in Chrome for the best experience as the Home Page might not apply CSS properties well in other browsers.

Post a New Blog  
* Users can create and submit new blog posts with a title and body.

Stories Page  
* View all blogs posted by the user.
* Includes blogs fetched from a fake API.

Connect with Me
